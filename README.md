# CAPSTONE_PROJECT: Top 50 songs of each country during Xmas ðŸŽ„
My project is an analysis of the dataset by Leordardo Henrique on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-50-spotify-songs-by-each-country.
It talks about the favorites songs that a lot of countries listen to.
## Description and analysis summary:
### Goals:
- Find the top favorites of all countries: Artist, Songs, Genre.
- Find out if the song choices depend on the bpm.
- Find out if there is a correlation between the bpm with the energy and dancibility
### Description:
- imports
- data exploration
- data prepartion
- data visualization with mini analysis after each question
- Conclusion
### Analysis:
I found that many of the countries had similar taste when it came to their top favorites. Many songs and artist appeared multiple times in the list, which shows how strong of a popularity they were. 
However, when it came down to the analysis of all the songs, we found big difference. There was many different genres that they enjoyed, as well as enjoying songs with different bpms, some whic prefer lower, and some that prefer higher bpms.
I also saw that there were weak correlations when it came to the observations between the bpms vs the energy and dancibility.
